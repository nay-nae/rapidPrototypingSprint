<div class="para1">
    <p> Atomic Kitten is a British pop girl group formed in Liverpool in 1998, whose current members are Liz McClarnon, Jenny Frost and Natasha Hamilton. The group was founded by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD) members Andy McCluskey, and Stuart Kershaw, who served as principal songwriters during Atomic Kitten's early years. The group's debut album Right Now was released in October 2000 and charted at number 39 in the United Kingdom. After five top ten singles, original member Kerry Katona quit four weeks before 'Whole Again' reached number one in the UK Singles Chart and was replaced by former Precious singer Jenny Frost. 'Whole Again' became the group's most successful single, staying at number one for four weeks in the UK and six weeks in Germany, and reaching number one in many other territories; in Britain, it was the 13th best-selling single of the 2000s.[citation needed] The group re-released their debut album, with some tracks re-recorded with Frost's vocals: it peaked at number one in the UK and was certified double platinum after selling over 600,000 copies.

To date the group have had three UK number-one singles: 'Whole Again', the fourth-best-selling song of all time by a girl group in the UK; 'Eternal Flame', a song originally recorded by The Bangles; and 'The Tide Is High (Get the Feeling), a song originally recorded by The Paragons. They have sold over 10 million records worldwide.

    <p3>After making sporadic appearances in 2006 and 2008, it was announced that McClarnon, Hamilton, and Katona would reunite for the ITV2 series The Big Reunion, alongside five other pop groups of their time: B*Witched, Five, Liberty X, Honeyz and 911. Frost was unable to take part in the comeback because of her pregnancy. Katona left the group for a second time in December 2017 leaving the group as a duo until Frost returned to the group in 2021.
